# Faceit Users Retention and Toxicity Analysis
This project includes the data of players using the Faceit application. An analysis of player retention has been conducted from the day they
started using the Faceit platform. Additionally, a machine learning algorithm has been used to predict whether players displaying toxic
behavior pose a threat to this application.
